# Personal-Portfolio-Website
My Personal Portfolio towards my journey to become a software engineer!!!

<b>The website is still currently under development. (Target completion: 26 July 2021 - In-progress item 1-4)
<br>Temporarily hosted in Netlify: https://fervent-yalow-d12315.netlify.app</b>

<br>Completed:
1. Main components of the website (Home, Project and Contact page)
2. Added UI/UX design
3. Added animations for components
4. Responsive web design

In-Progress:
1. Implementing contact functionality (Sending email to me)
2. Code clean-up, refactoring and optimization for performance
3. Hosting the final website with my own domain name
4. Final user testing for performance & usability
5. Adding future completed projects + their transitions (each project card will direct to a new page) into the Project page (Note: This would be started after the completion of this project)
