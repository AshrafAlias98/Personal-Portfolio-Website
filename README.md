<br>Completed:
1. Main components of the website (Home, Project and Contact page)
2. Added UI/UX design
3. Added animations for components
4. Responsive web design
5. Implementing contact functionality
6. Code clean-up, refactoring and optimization for performance

Future work:
1. Adding future completed projects + their transitions (each project card will direct to a new page) into the Project page
